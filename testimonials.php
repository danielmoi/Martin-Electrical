        <p>Great Service. The electrician came on time. He fixed and replaced everything I asked for correctly and quickly without any mess. The price was reasonable and well worth the service and quality provided. I will be recommending Martin Electrical and will use them again. Thanks lads.</p>

      <p>We were extremely impressed with Sam's diligence and workmanship. He went above and beyond by removing residue around the exhaust fan in the laundry area. He tidied all areas well and took away all old materials for disposal. We would highly recommend Sam for any electrical work to other customers.</p>

      <p>I was pleased with the rewiring work done on my house in May. The team was a great lot of young men and I will certainly use your services again if they are required. Many thanks.</p>

      <p>Just a short note on the great service I had from your company once again, and to give you feedback . I phoned just before 7am and my call was handled very professionally / in a friendly manner. The lady on the phone informed me that I would have an electrician asap. Within an hour there were two very happy professional electricians on the job and it took no time for them to sort out the problem. Thank you for a job well done. I will continue to recommend your company to others.</p>
